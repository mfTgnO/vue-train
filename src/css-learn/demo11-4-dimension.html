    Setting max-width
    The max-width property is used to set the maximum width of an element.

    The max-width can be specified in length values, like px, cm, etc., or in percent (%) of the containing block,
    or set to none (this is default. Means that there is no maximum width).

    The problem with the <div> above occurs when the browser window is smaller than the width of the element (500px).
    The browser then adds a horizontal scrollbar to the page.

    Using max-width instead, in this situation, will improve the browser's handling of small windows.

    Tip: Drag the browser window to smaller than 500px wide, to see the difference between the two divs!

    Note: The value of the max-width property overrides width.
