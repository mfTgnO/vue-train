    How To Add CSS

    When a browser reads a style sheet, it will format the HTML document according to the information in the style sheet.
    Three Ways to Insert CSS

    There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
        External CSS
        Internal CSS
        Inline CSS

    -->
    <!--
    External CSS
    With an external style sheet, you can change the look of an entire website by changing just one file!

    Each HTML page must include a reference to the external style sheet file inside the <link> element, inside the head section.
    -->
    <!--
    An external style sheet can be written in any text editor, and must be saved with a .css extension.

    The external .css file should not contain any HTML tags.
    -->
    <!--
    Note: Do not add a space between the property value and the unit (such as margin-left: 20 px;). The correct way is: margin-left: 20px;
    -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</body>
</html>
