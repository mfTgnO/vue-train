    When the text-align property is set to "justify", each line is stretched so that every line has equal width,
    and the left and right margins are straight (like in magazines and newspapers):

        h1 {
            text-align: center;
        }

        h2 {
            text-align: left;
        }

        h3 {
            text-align: right;
        }
    </style>

<body>
<h1>Heading 1 (center)</h1>
<h2>Heading 2 (left)</h2>
<h3>Heading 3 (right)</h3>

<p>The three headings above are aligned center, left and right.</p>
