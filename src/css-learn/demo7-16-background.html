    CSS background - Shorthand property
    To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the background properties in one single property.
    This is called a shorthand property.

    Instead of writing:
    -->
    <style>
        body {
            background: #ffffff url("image/img_tree.png") no-repeat right top;
            margin-right: 200px;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>The background Property</h1>

<p>The background property is a shorthand property for specifying all the background properties in one declaration.</p>

<p>Here, the background image is only shown once, and it is also positioned in the top-right corner.</p>

<p>We have also added a right margin, so that the text will not write over the background image.</p>
</body>
