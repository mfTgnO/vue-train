    An outline is a line drawn outside the element's border.

    CSS Outline
    An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, OUTSIDE the borders, to make the element "stand out".

    CSS has the following outline properties:
        outline-style
        outline-color
        outline-width
        outline-offset
        outline

    Note: Outline differs from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn outside the element's border,
    and may overlap other content. Also, the outline is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's
    total width and height is not affected by the width of the outline.

            margin: auto;
            text-align: center;
