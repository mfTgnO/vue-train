    HTML and CSS Comments
    From the HTML tutorial, you learned that you can add comments to your HTML source by using the <\!--...--\> syntax.

    In the following example, we use a combination of HTML and CSS comments:
    -->
    <style>
        p {
            color: red; /* Set text color to red */
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<!-- These paragraphs will be red -->
<p>Hello World!</p>
<p>This paragraph is styled with CSS.</p>
<p>CSS comments are not shown in the output.</p>
</body>
</html>
