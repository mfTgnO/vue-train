    Text Alignment

    The text-align property is used to set the horizontal alignment of a text.

    A text can be left or right aligned, centered, or justified.

    The following example shows center aligned, and left and right aligned text
    (left alignment is default if text direction is left-to-right, and right alignment
    is default if text direction is right-to-left):
    -->
    <style>
        div {
            border: 1px solid black;
            padding: 10px;
            width: 200px;
            height: 200px;
            text-align: justify;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<h1>Example text-align: justify;</h1>

<p>The text-align: justify; value stretches the lines so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers and
    magazines).</p>

    In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever
    since. 'Whenever you feel like criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this world
    haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
