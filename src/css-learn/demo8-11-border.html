    So, here is how it works:

    If the border-style property has four values:
        border-style: dotted solid double dashed;
            top border is dotted
            right border is solid
            bottom border is double
            left border is dashed

    If the border-style property has three values:
        border-style: dotted solid double;
            top border is dotted
            right and left borders are solid
            bottom border is double

    If the border-style property has two values:
        border-style: dotted solid;
            top and bottom borders are dotted
            right and left borders are solid

    If the border-style property has one value:
        border-style: dotted;
            all four borders are dotted
    -->
    <style>
        p {
            border-style: dotted solid;
        }
    </style>
