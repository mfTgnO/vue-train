    White Space
    The white-space property specifies how white-space inside an element is handled.

    This example demonstrates how to disable text wrapping inside an element:
    -->
    <style>
        p {
            white-space: nowrap;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>White Space</h2>

<p>
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
    This is some text. This is some text. This is some text.
</p>

<p>Try to remove the white-space property to see the difference.</p>
