    What are Web Safe Fonts?
    Web safe fonts are fonts that are universally installed across all browsers and devices.

    Fallback Fonts
    However, there are no 100% completely web safe fonts. There is always a chance that a font
    is not found or is not installed properly.

    Therefore, it is very important to always use fallback fonts.

    This means that you should add a list of similar "backup fonts" in the font-family property.
    If the first font does not work, the browser will try the next one, and the next one, and so on.
    Always end the list with a generic font family name.
