    Font Size
    The font-size property sets the size of the text.

    Being able to manage the text size is important in web design. However, you should not use font size
    adjustments to make paragraphs look like headings, or headings look like paragraphs.

    Always use the proper HTML tags, like <h1> - <h6> for headings and <p> for paragraphs.

    The font-size value can be an absolute, or relative size.

    Absolute size:
        Sets the text to a specified size
        Does not allow a user to change the text size in all browsers (bad for accessibility reasons)
        Absolute size is useful when the physical size of the output is known

    Relative size:
        Sets the size relative to surrounding elements
        Allows a user to change the text size in browsers

    Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).

    Tip: If you use pixels, you can still use the zoom tool to resize the entire page.
