    Sometimes two margins collapse into a single margin.

    Margin Collapse
    Top and bottom margins of elements are sometimes collapsed into a single margin that is
    equal to the largest of the two margins.

    This does not happen on left and right margins! Only top and bottom margins!

    Look at the following example:

    In the example above, the <h1> element has a bottom margin of 50px and the <h2> element has a top margin set to 20px.

    Common sense would seem to suggest that the vertical margin between the <h1> and the <h2> would be a
    total of 70px (50px + 20px). But due to margin collapse, the actual margin ends up being 50px.

    <style>
        /*Set different margins for all four sides of a <p> element:*/
        h1 {
            margin: 0 0 50px 0;
        }

        h2 {
            margin: 20px 0 0 0;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<p>In this example the h1 element has a bottom margin of 50px and the h2 element has a top margin of 20px. So, the
    vertical margin between h1 and h2 should have been 70px (50px + 20px). However, due to margin collapse, the actual
    margin ends up being 50px.</p>

<h1>Heading 1</h1>
<h2>Heading 2</h2>
