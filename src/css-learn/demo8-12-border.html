    CSS Border - Shorthand Property
    Like you saw in the previous page, there are many properties to consider when dealing with borders.

    To shorten the code, it is also possible to specify all the individual border properties in one property.

    The border property is a shorthand property for the following individual border properties:
        border-width
        border-style (required)
        border-color
    -->
    <style>
        p {
            border: 5px solid red;
        }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
<h2>The border Property</h2>

<p>This property is a shorthand property for border-width, border-style, and border-color.</p>
