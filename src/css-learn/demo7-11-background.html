    CSS background-repeat: no-repeat
    Showing the background image only once is also specified by the background-repeat property:

    In the example above, the background image is placed in the same place as the text.
    We want to change the position of the image, so that it does not disturb the text too much.

        /*Show the background image only once:*/
        body {
            background-image: url("image/img_tree.png");
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
