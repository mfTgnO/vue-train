    Background Cover
    If you want the background image to cover the entire element, you can set the background-size property to cover.

    Also, to make sure the entire element is always covered, set the background-attachment property to fixed:

    This way, the background image will cover the entire element, with no stretching (the image will keep its original proportions):

    <style>
        body {
            background-image: url("./image/img_girl.jpg");
            background-repeat: no-repeat;
            background-attachment: fixed;
            background-size: cover;
        }
    </style>

<body>
<h2>Background Image</h2>

<p>By default, the background image will repeat itself if it is smaller than the element where it is specified, in this
    case the body element.</p>
