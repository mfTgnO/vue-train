    The HTML id attribute is used to specify a unique id for an HTML element.
    You cannot have more than one element with the same id in an HTML document.

    Using The id Attribute
    The id attribute specifies a unique id for an HTML element. The value of the id attribute must be unique within the HTML document.
    The id attribute is used to point to a specific style declaration in a style sheet. It is also used by JavaScript to access and manipulate the element with the specific id.
    The syntax for id is: write a hash character (#), followed by an id name. Then, define the CSS properties within curly braces {}.

    Note: The id name is case sensitive!
    Note: The id name must contain at least one character, and must not contain whitespaces (spaces, tabs, etc.).

    <style>
        #myHeader {
            background-color: lightblue;
            color: black;
            padding: 40px;
            text-align: center;
        }

        .city {
            background-color: tomato;
            color: white;
            padding: 10px;
        }
    </style>

<body>
<!--
In the following example we have an <h1> element that points to the id name "myHeader". This <h1> element will be styled according to the #myHeader style definition in the head section:
-->
<h2>The id Attribute</h2>
<p>Use CSS to style an element with the id "myHeader":</p>

<h1 id="myHeader">My Header</h1>

<!--
Difference Between Class and ID
A class name can be used by multiple HTML elements, while an id name must only be used by one HTML element within the page:
-->
<h2 class="city">London</h2>
<p>London is the capital of England.</p>

<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
<p>Paris is the capital of France.</p>

<h2 class="city">Tokyo</h2>
<p>Tokyo is the capital of Japan.</p>

HTML Bookmarks with ID and Links
HTML bookmarks are used to allow readers to jump to specific parts of a webpage.

Bookmarks can be useful if your page is very long.

To use a bookmark, you must first create it, and then add a link to it.

Then, when the link is clicked, the page will scroll to the location with the bookmark.
