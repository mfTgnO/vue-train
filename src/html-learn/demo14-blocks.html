    <title>HTML Block and Inline Elements</title>

    Every HTML element has a default display value, depending on what type of element it is.
    There are two display values: block and inline.

Block-level Elements
A block-level element always starts on a new line.
A block-level element always takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).
A block level element has a top and a bottom margin, whereas an inline element does not.

Here are the block-level elements in HTML:
<address> <article> <aside> <blockquote> <canvas> <dd> <div> <dl> <dt> <fieldset> <figcaption> <figure> <footer> <form> <h1>-<h6> <header> <hr> <li> <main> <nav> <noscript> <ol> <p> <pre> <section> <table> <tfoot> <ul> <video>
-->
<div style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</div>
<p>The DIV element is a block element, and will always start on a new line and take up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>

<!--
Inline Elements
An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
This is a <span> element inside a paragraph.

Here are the inline elements in HTML:
<a> <abbr> <acronym> <b> <bdo> <big> <br> <button> <cite> <code> <dfn> <em> <i> <img> <input> <kbd> <label> <map> <object> <output> <q> <samp> <script> <select> <small> <span> <strong> <sub> <sup> <textarea> <time> <tt> <var>

Note: An inline element cannot contain a block-level element!
-->
<p>This is an inline span <span style="border: 1px solid black">Hello World</span> element inside a paragraph.</p>
<p>The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary.</p>

<!--
The <div> Element
The <div> element is often used as a container for other HTML elements.
The <div> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <div> element can be used to style blocks of content:
-->
<div style="background-color: black;color: white;padding: 20px">
    <h2>London</h2>
    <p>London is the capital city of England. It is the most populous city in the United Kingdom, with a metropolitan area of over 13 million inhabitants.</p>
    <p>Standing on the River Thames, London has been a major settlement for two millennia, its history going back to its founding by the Romans, who named it Londinium.</p>
</div>

<!--
The <span> Element
The <span> element is an inline container used to mark up a part of a text, or a part of a document.
The <span> element has no required attributes, but style, class and id are common.
When used together with CSS, the <span> element can be used to style parts of the text:
-->
<h1>The span element</h1>
<p>My mother has <span style="color:blue;font-weight:bold">blue</span> eyes and my father has <span style="color:darkolivegreen;font-weight:bold">dark green</span> eyes.</p>
