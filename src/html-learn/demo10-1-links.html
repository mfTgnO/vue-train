    Note: A link does not have to be text. A link can be an image or any other HTML element!

    By default, links will appear as follows in all browsers:

    An unvisited link is underlined and blue
    A visited link is underlined and purple
    An active link is underlined and red

    HTML Links - The target Attribute
    By default, the linked page will be displayed in the current browser window. To change this, you must specify another target for the link.
    The target attribute specifies where to open the linked document.
    The target attribute can have one of the following values:
    _self - Default. Opens the document in the same window/tab as it was clicked
    _blank - Opens the document in a new window or tab
    _parent - Opens the document in the parent frame
    _top - Opens the document in the full body of the window

HTML Links - Use an Image as a Link
To use an image as a link, just put the <img> tag inside the <a> tag:
-->
<a href="image/1357386713-Untitled4-o.jpg">
    <img src="image/1300510.jpg" alt="HTML tutorial" style="width:42px;height:42px;">
</a>

<!--
Link to an Email Address
Use mailto: inside the href attribute to create a link that opens the user's email program (to let them send a new email):
-->
<br>
<a href="mailto:someone@example.com">Send email</a>

<!--
Button as a Link
To use an HTML button as a link, you have to add some JavaScript code.
JavaScript allows you to specify what happens at certain events, such as a click of a button:
-->
<br>
<button onclick="document.location='image/1357386713-Untitled4-o.jpg'">HTML Tutorial</button>

<!--
Link Titles
The title attribute specifies extra information about an element. The information is most often shown as a tooltip text when the mouse moves over the element.
