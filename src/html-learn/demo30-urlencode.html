    A URL is another word for a web address.
    A URL can be composed of words (e.g. w3schools.com), or an Internet Protocol (IP) address (e.g. 192.68.20.50).
    Most people enter the name when surfing, because names are easier to remember than numbers.

    URL - Uniform Resource Locator
    Web browsers request pages from web servers by using a URL.
    A Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is used to address a document (or other data) on the web.
    A web address like https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp follows these syntax rules:
    scheme://prefix.domain:port/path/filename

    Explanation:
    scheme - defines the type of Internet service (most common is http or https)
    prefix - defines a domain prefix (default for http is www)
    domain - defines the Internet domain name (like w3schools.com)
    port - defines the port number at the host (default for http is 80)
    path - defines a path at the server (If omitted: the root directory of the site)
    filename - defines the name of a document or resource
