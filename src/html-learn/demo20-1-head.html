    The HTML <head> element is a container for the following elements: <title>, <style>, <meta>, <link>, <script>, and <base>.

    The HTML <head> Element
    The <head> element is a container for metadata (data about data) and is placed between the <html> tag and the <body> tag.

    HTML metadata is data about the HTML document. Metadata is not displayed.

    Metadata typically define the document title, character set, styles, scripts, and other meta information.

    The HTML <title> Element
    The <title> element defines the title of the document. The title must be text-only, and it is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab.

    The <title> element is required in HTML documents!

    The contents of a page title is very important for search engine optimization (SEO)! The page title is used by search engine algorithms to decide the order when listing pages in search results.

    The <title> element:

    defines a title in the browser toolbar
    provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites
    displays a title for the page in search engine-results
    So, try to make the title as accurate and meaningful as possible!
