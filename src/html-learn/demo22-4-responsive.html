    Notice that in the example above, the image can be scaled up to be larger than its original size. A better solution, in many cases, will be to use the max-width property instead.

<body>
<h2>Responsive Image</h2>
<p>"max-width:100%" prevents the image from getting bigger than its original size. However, if you make the browser window smaller, the image will still scale down.</p>

<img src="image/img_girl.jpg" style="max-width: 100%;height: auto">
